Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work selects a pair of least-favorable distributions from these sets to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions.

Since human values can be personalized and dynamically change over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different ethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks, it is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across different directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach called Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment across multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates the alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints, which define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a primal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target is achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to constraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and sequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient for multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP’s ability to align multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical performance across various tasks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICLR</abbr> </div> <div id="le2025probe" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Probe Pruning: Accelerating LLMs through Dynamic Pruning via Model-Probing</div> <div class="author"> Qi Le, Enmao Diao, Ziyan Wang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model’s output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing-using just 1.5% of FLOPs-can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of runtime reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40% pruning ratio.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">NAACL</abbr> </div> <div id="wang2025aid" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">AID: Adaptive Integration of Detectors for Safe AI with Language Models</div> <div class="author"> Xinran Wang, Enmao Diao, Qi Le, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

However, defining “safety” is complex, given that entities across domains may interpret it through varied lenses and develop safety detectors—models trained to identify specific unsafe content based on predefined criteria. To address this complexity, we introduce the approach of Adaptive Integration of Detectors (AID) to orchestrate the strengths of multiple pretrained detectors to ensure comprehensive effectiveness in diverse scenarios. AID employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, wherein it dynamically assigns and learns data-adaptive weights for each detector using domain-specific annotated data and LLM-extracted features. We provide theoretical insights into why MoE can be effective by showing its optimality in a Neyman-Pearson setting. Our experimental studies using various detection tasks curated from benchmark datasets demonstrate AID’s ability to synergistically combine the unique capabilities of individual detectors. For example, it is observed that AID can improve the area under the curve (AUC) by an absolute value of 0.07 to 0.21, with a median of 0.12, compared to the best individual detectors developed for specific safety aspects. The improvement is particularly significant for complex detection tasks that mix different unsafe data sources. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">IEEE BigData</abbr> </div> <div id="le2024dynamicfl" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">DynamicFL: Federated Learning with Dynamic Communication Resource Allocation</div> <div class="author"> Qi Le, Enmao Diao, Xinran Wang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

However, considerable statistical heterogeneity in local data across devices often leads to suboptimal model performance compared with independently and identically distributed (IID) data scenarios. In this paper, we introduce DynamicFL, a new FL framework that investigates the trade-offs between global model performance and communication costs for two widely adopted FL methods: Federated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FedSGD) and Federated Averaging (FedAvg). Our approach allocates diverse communication resources to clients based on their data statistical heterogeneity, considering communication resource constraints, and attains substantial performance enhancements compared to uniform communication resource allocation. Notably, our method bridges the gap between FedSGD and FedAvg, providing a flexible framework leveraging communication heterogeneity to address statistical heterogeneity in FL. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DynamicFL surpasses current state-of-the-art methods with up to a 10% increase in model accuracy, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness in tackling data statistical heterogeneity challenges.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">EMNLP</abbr> </div> <div id="gu2024esc" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ESC: Efficient Speech Coding with Cross-Scale Residual Vector Quantized Transformers</div> <div class="author"> Yuzhe Gu, and Enmao Diao </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19441" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/yzguu830/efficient-speech-codec" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Neural speech codecs aim to compress input signals into minimal bits while maintaining content quality in a low-latency manner. However, existing neural codecs often trade model complexity for reconstruction performance. These codecs primarily use convolutional blocks for feature transformation, which are not inherently suited for capturing the local redundancies in speech signals. To compensate, they require either adversarial discriminators or a large number of model parameters to enhance audio quality. In response to these challenges, we introduce the Efficient Speech Codec (ESC), a lightweight, parameter-efficient speech codec based on a cross-scale residual vector quantization scheme and transformers. Our model employs mirrored hierarchical window transformer blocks and performs step-wise decoding from coarse-to-fine feature representations. To enhance bitrate efficiency, we propose a novel combination of vector quantization techniques along with a pre-training paradigm.

Challenges involved in this problem lie in the difficulties with modeling the variations of the rough surface profile. In this paper, we propose a novel PixelCNN based method for reducing rough surface clutter in GPR B-scan images. In the proposed method, the rough surface region in a B-scan image is split into small patches which are used to train a PixelCNN model. Given an input patch, the trained PixelCNN model can output the probability that the input patch comes from the rough surface region. For reconstructing a clutter reduced B-scan, the entire B-scan image is split into patches and each patch is input into the trained PixelCNN model to get its corresponding probability. Negative log-probabilities are then utilized as scores to suppress the rough surface region and to enhance the target profile in the B-scan image. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we test it on four simulation B-scan images and two real-world B-scan images. The proposed method is compared with traditional subspace projection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms traditional subspace projection methods.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">arXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="diao2023cola" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">ColA: Collaborative Adaptation with Gradient Learning</div> <div class="author"> Enmao Diao, Qi Le, Suya Wu, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 4 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '4 more authors' ?

We propose a deep autoencoder-based method to mitigate rough surface clutter in GPR images by treating it as an anomaly detection problem. First, the rough surface region in a B-scan image is partitioned into small patches, which act as the training dataset for the deep autoencoder. Through the training process, the autoencoder learns and captures the patterns associated with the rough surface patches. Following training, the entire B-scan image is divided into small patches of the same size as the training patches, and each of them is fed into the autoencoder to compute an anomaly score. To reconstruct a clutter-reduced B-scan image, we employ a weighted sum approach to aggregate all patches based on their anomaly scores. We evaluate our method against conventional subspace projection techniques using simulated and field-collected B-scans. The results clearly indicate that our approach surpasses these subspace methods.

Such an approach may not be feasible for various machine learning models because of the complexity of computing the explicit distributions. Additionally, these methods may suffer from a lack of robustness to model mismatch and noise. This paper develops a new variant of the classical Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm for the quickest change detection. This variant is based on Fisher divergence and the Hyvärinen score and is called the Hyvärinen score-based CUSUM (SCUSUM) algorithm. The SCUSUM algorithm allows the applications of change detection for unnormalized statistical models, i.e., models for which the probability density function contains an unknown normalization constant. The asymptotic optimality of the proposed algorithm is investigated by deriving expressions for average detection delay and the mean running time to a false alarm.

This has resulted in significant demand for data, computation, and energy resources. In this light, it is crucial to enhance and optimize the efficiency of these ML models and algorithms. Additionally, the rise in computational capabilities of modern devices has prompted a shift towards distributed systems that enable localized data storage and model training. While this evolution promises substantial potential, it introduces a series of challenges. Such challenges encompass addressing the heterogeneity across systems, data, models, and supervision, balancing the trade-off among communication, computation, and performance, as well as building a community of shared interest to encourage collaboration in the emerging era of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).In this dissertation, we contribute to the establishment of a theoretically justified, methodologically comprehensive, and universally applicable Efficient and Collaborative Distributed Machine Learning framework. Specifically, in Part I, we contribute to methodologies for Efficient Machine Learning including for both learning and inference. In this direction, we propose a parameter-efficient model, namely Restricted Recurrent Neural Networks (RRNN), that leverage the recurrent structures of RNNs using weight sharing in order to improve learning efficiency. We also introduce an optimal measure of vector sparsity named the PQ Index (PQI), and postulate a hypothesis connecting this sparsity measure and compressibility of neural networks. Based on this, we propose a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. This algorithm adaptively determines the pruning ratio to enhance inference efficiency. In Part II, we address both efficiency and collaboration in Distributed Machine Learning. We introduce Distributed Recurrent Autoencoders for Scalable Image Compression (DRASIC), a data-driven Distributed Source Coding framework that can compress heterogeneous data in a scalable and distributed manner. We then propose Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HeteroFL), demonstrating the feasibility of training localized heterogeneous models to create a global inference model. Subsequently, we propose a new Federated Learning (FL) framework, namely SemiFL, to tackle Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSFL) for clients with unlabeled data. This method performs comparably with state-of-the-art centralized Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), and fully supervised FL techniques. Finally, we propose Gradient Assisted Learning (GAL) in order to enable collaborations among multiple organizations without sharing data, models, and objective functions. This method significantly out-performs local learning baselines and achieves near-oracle performance. In Part III, we develop collaborative applications for building a community of shared interest. We apply SemiFL to Keyword Spotting (KWS), a technique widely used in virtual assistants. Numerical experiments demonstrate that one can train models from the scratch, or transfer from pre-trained models in order to leverage heterogeneous unlabeled on-device data, using only a small amount of labeled data from the server. Finally, we propose a Decentralized Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (DMTCDR) which enhances the recommendation performance of decentralized organizations without compromising data privacy or model confidentiality.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">KDD</abbr> </div> <div id="varma2023once" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Once-for-All Federated Learning: Learning From and Deploying to Heterogeneous Clients</div> <div class="author"> Kamala Varma, Enmao Diao, Tanya Roosta, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

As FL often involves various smart devices, it is important to adapt the FL pipeline to accommodate device resource constraints. This work addresses the problem of training and storing memory-intensive deep neural network architectures on resource-constrained devices. Existing solutions often involve computationally expensive methods. We propose Once-for-All Federated Learning (OFA-FL) to overcome this limitation by learning a model that concurrently optimizes sub-networks of various sizes. Clients can therefore receive the sub-network best suited for their device resources without extra computation.

In this study, we first demonstrate the effectiveness of Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (SSL) and FL for KWS.

Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">AISTATS</abbr> </div> <div id="wu2023score" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Score-based Quickest Change Detection for Unnormalized Models</div> <div class="author"> Suya Wu, Enmao Diao, Taposh Banerjee, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

We propose SemiFL to address the problem of combining communication-efficient FL such as FedAvg with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). In SemiFL, clients have completely unlabeled data and can train multiple local epochs to reduce communication costs, while the server has a small amount of labeled data. We provide a theoretical understanding of the success of data augmentation-based SSL methods to illustrate the bottleneck of a vanilla combination of communication-efficient FL with SSL. To address this issue, we propose alternate training to ’fine-tune global model with labeled data’ and ’generate pseudo-labels with the global model.’ We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of a labeled server with unlabeled clients training with multiple local epochs.

Typical approaches to FL aim to learn a single model that simultaneously performs well for all clients. But such an approach may be ineffective when the clients’ data distributions are heterogeneous. In these cases, we aim to learn personalized models for each client’s data yet still leverage shared information across clients. A critical avenue that may allow for such personalization is the presence of client-specific side information available to each client, such as client embeddings obtained from domain-specific knowledge, pre-trained models, or simply one-hot encodings. In this work, we propose a new FL framework for utilizing a general form of client-specific side information for personalized federated learning. We prove that incorporating side information can improve model performance for simplified multi-task linear regression and matrix completion problems. Further, we validate these results with image classification experiments on Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, revealing that proper use of side information can be beneficial for personalization.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Asilomar</abbr> </div> <div id="le2022personalized" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Personalized Federated Recommender Systems with Private and Partially Federated AutoEncoders</div> <div class="author"> Qi Le, Enmao Diao, Xinran Wang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Conventional RSs often need to collect users’ data, centralize them on the server-side, and form a global model to generate reliable recommendations. However, they suffer from two critical limitations: the personalization problem that the RSs trained traditionally may not be customized for individual users, and the privacy problem that directly sharing user data is not encouraged. We propose Personalized Federated Recommender Systems (PersonalFR), which introduces a personalized autoencoder-based recommendation model with Federated Learning (FL) to address these challenges. PersonalFR guarantees that each user can learn a personal model from the local dataset and other participating users’ data without sharing local data, data embeddings, or models. PersonalFR consists of three main components, including AutoEncoder-based RSs (ARSs) that learn the user-item interactions, Partially Federated Learning (PFL) that updates the encoder locally and aggregates the decoder on the server-side, and Partial Compression (PC) that only computes and transmits active model parameters. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that PersonalFR can achieve private and personalized performance comparable to that trained by centralizing all users’ data. Moreover, PersonalFR requires significantly less computation and communication overhead than standard FL baselines.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">IEEE Access</abbr> </div> <div id="wu2022score" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Score-based Hypothesis Testing for Unnormalized Models</div> <div class="author"> Suya Wu, Enmao Diao, Khalil Elkhalil, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 2 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '2 more authors' ?

Our approach is motivated by the success of score matching techniques that avoid the intensive computational costs of normalization constants in many high-dimensional settings. Our proposed test statistic is the difference between Hyvärinen scores corresponding to the null and alternative hypotheses. Under some reasonable conditions, we prove that the asymptotic distribution of this statistic is Chi-squared. We outline a bootstrap approach to learn the test critical values, particularly when the distribution under the null hypothesis cannot be expressed in a closed form, and provide consistency guarantees.

The deep learning framework incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as preserving incompressibility and global statistical invariants of velocity gradient tensor. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical and physics-based metrics. The data set comes from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically stationary, isotropic turbulent flow in a cubic box. Since the size of the dataset is memory intensive, we first generate a low-dimensional representation of the velocity data, and then pass it to a sequence prediction network that learns the spatial and temporal correlations of the underlying data. The dimensionality reduction is performed via extraction using Vector-Quantized Autoencoder (VQ-AE), which learns the discrete latent variables. For the sequence forecasting, the idea of Transformer architecture from natural language processing is used, and its performance compared against more standard Recurrent Networks (such as Convolutional LSTM). These architectures are designed and trained to perform a sequence to sequence multi-class classification task in which they take an input sequence with a fixed length (k) and predict a sequence with a fixed length (p), representing the future time instants of the flow. Our results for the short-term predictions show that the accuracy of results for both models deteriorates across predicted snapshots due to autoregressive nature of the predictions. Based on our diagnostics tests, the trained Conv-Transformer model outperforms the Conv-LSTM one and can accurately, both quantitatively and qualitatively, retain the large scales and capture well the inertial scales of flow but fails at recovering the small and intermittent fluid motions.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">arXiv</abbr> </div> <div id="diao2021decentralized" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Decentralized Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation for Multi-organization Collaborations</div> <div class="author"> Enmao Diao, Vahid Tarokh, and Jie Ding </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.13340</em>, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13340" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/diaoenmao/Decentralized-Multi-Target-Cross-Domain-Recommendation-for-Multi-organization-Collaborations" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recommender Systems (RSs) are operated locally by different organizations in many realistic scenarios.

Large models tend to inflate the variance (or overfitting), while small models tend to cause biases (or underfitting) for a given fixed dataset. In this work, we address the critical challenge of model selection to strike a balance between model fitting and model complexity, thus gaining reliable predictive power. We consider the task of approaching the theoretical limit of statistical learning, meaning that the selected model has the predictive performance that is as good as the best possible model given a class of potentially misspecified candidate models. We propose a generalized notion of Takeuchi’s information criterion and prove that the proposed method can asymptotically achieve the optimal out-sample prediction loss under reasonable assumptions. It is the first proof of the asymptotic property of Takeuchi’s information criterion to our best knowledge. Our proof applies to a wide variety of nonlinear models, loss functions, and high dimensionality (in the sense that the models’ complexity can grow with sample size). The proposed method can be used as a computationally efficient surrogate for leave-one-out cross-validation. Moreover, for modeling streaming data, we propose an online algorithm that sequentially expands the model complexity to enhance selection stability and reduce computation cost. Experimental studies show that the proposed method has desirable predictive power and significantly less computational cost than some popular methods.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">ICASSP</abbr> </div> <div id="wang2020speech" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Speech Emotion Recognition with Dual-Sequence LSTM Architecture</div> <div class="author"> Jianyou Wang, Michael Xue, Ryan Culhane, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

Once jointly trained for compression and clustering, the model can be decomposed into two parts: a data vendor that encodes the raw data into compressed data, and a data consumer that classifies the received (compressed) data.

In this paper, we present a new methodology to significantly reduce the number of parameters in RNNs while maintaining performance that is comparable or even better than classical RNNs. The new proposal, referred to as Restricted Recurrent Neural Network (RRNN), restricts the weight matrices corresponding to the input data and hidden states at each time step to share a large proportion of parameters. The new architecture can be regarded as a compression of its classical counterpart, but it does not require pre-training or sophisticated parameter fine-tuning, both of which are major issues in most existing compression techniques. Experiments on natural language modeling show that compared with its classical counterpart, the restricted recurrent architecture generally produces comparable results at about 50% compression rate.

Because large models tend to overfit while small models tend to underfit for a given fixed dataset, a critical challenge is to select an appropriate model (e.g. set of variables/features). Model selection aims to strike a balance between the goodness of fit and model complexity, and thus to gain reliable predictive power. In this paper, we study a penalized model selection technique that asymptotically achieves the optimal expected prediction loss (referred to as the limit of learning) offered by a set of candidate models. We prove that the proposed procedure is both statistically efficient in the sense that it asymptotically approaches the limit of learning, and computationally efficient in the sense that it can be much faster than cross validation methods. Our theory applies for a wide variety of model classes, loss functions, and high dimensions (in the sense that the models’ complexity can grow with data size). We released a python package with our proposed method for general usage like logistic regression and neural networks.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
